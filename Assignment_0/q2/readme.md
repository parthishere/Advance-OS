# Virtual Memory Layout Analyzer


## 1. Process Information

- **Process ID (PID)**: 50531
- **Virtual Address Space Size**: 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF (18,446,744,073,709,551,615 bytes)

The virtual address space size indicates that this is a 64-bit process, allowing for an theoretical address space of 16 exabytes.

## 2. Memory Segments in Detail

### 2.1. Code Segment (Text)

- Main function address: 0x5d4f2d936791
- Segment range: 0x5d4f2d936000 - 0x5d4f2d937000 (size: 4096 bytes)

### 3.2. Data Segment

- Initialized (Read/Write): 0x5d4f2d939010 (global2)
- Initialized (Read-Only): 0x5d4f2d939018 (global3)
- Static data: 0x5d4f2d939014
- Uninitialized (BSS): 0x5d4f2d939024 (global1)
- Segment range: 0x5d4f2d939000 - 0x5d4f2d93a000 (size: 4096 bytes)

The data segment is divided into several subsections:
- Initialized data (both read/write and read-only)
- Static data
- Uninitialized data (BSS - Block Started by Symbol)

The BSS section typically comes after the initialized data.

### 2.3. Heap Segment

- First allocation: 0x5d4f2e3f72b0
- Second allocation: 0x5d4f2e3f72d0
- Current Heap end: 0x5d4f2e417000
- Segment range: 0x5d4f2e3f6000 - 0x5d4f2e417000 (size: 135,168 bytes)

The heap grows upwards (towards higher addresses). 

### 2.4. Stack Segment

- Local variable 1: 0x7ffc111bc450
- Local variable 2: 0x7ffc111bc454
- argc: 0x7ffc111bc44c
- argv: 0x7ffc111bc5a8
- Stack growth demonstration:
  - 0x7ffc111bc424
  - 0x7ffc111bc3f4
  - 0x7ffc111bc3c4
  - 0x7ffc111bc394
  - 0x7ffc111bc364
  - 0x7ffc111bc334
- Segment range: 0x7ffc1119d000 - 0x7ffc111be000 (size: 135,168 bytes)

The stack grows downwards (towards lower addresses).

### 2.5. Memory-Mapped Segment

- mmap allocation: 0x707c26c83000

Memory-mapped regions are typically used for loading shared libraries, mapping files to memory, or as an alternative to heap allocations for large chunks of memory.

## 3. Detailed Memory Map Analysis

The `/proc` filesystem provides detailed information about the process's memory layout:

1. Text (Code) segment: 0x5d4f2d936000 - 0x5d4f2d937000 (4,096 bytes)
2. Data segment: 0x5d4f2d939000 - 0x5d4f2d93a000 (4,096 bytes)
3. Heap segment: 0x5d4f2e3f6000 - 0x5d4f2e417000 (135,168 bytes)
4. Stack segment: 0x7ffc1119d000 - 0x7ffc111be000 (135,168 bytes)

This map confirms our earlier observations about the locations of different segments and their sizes.


## 4. Analysis and Answers to Questions

1. **What is the size of your process' virtual address space?**
   
   The virtual address space size is 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF (18,446,744,073,709,551,615 bytes or 16 exbibytes). This indicates a 64-bit address space, which is the maximum theoretical addressable memory for a 64-bit system.

2. **Identify the locations where argv and argc are stored.**
   
   - argc is stored at address 0x7ffd49de59ac
   - argv is stored at address 0x7ffd49de5b08
   
   Both are located in the stack segment, which is expected as they are function parameters for the main function.

3. **What are the addresses of code, static data, stack and heap?**
   
   - Code (Text): Starts at 0x604fe9127000
   - Static Data: Starts at 0x604fe912a000 (includes initialized and uninitialized data)
   - Heap: Starts at 0x604feafa0000
   - Stack: Starts at 0x7ffd49dc7000 (grows downwards)

4. **In what directions do the stack and the heap grow? Explain your answer by using the virtual memory layouts at different execution phases.**
   
   - Heap grows upwards (from lower to higher addresses):
     - First allocation: 0x604feafa12b0
     - Second allocation: 0x604feafa12d0
     This shows that subsequent allocations have higher addresses.

   - Stack grows downwards (from higher to lower addresses):
     - The recursive function calls show addresses decreasing:
       0x7ffd49de5984 -> 0x7ffd49de5954 -> 0x7ffd49de5924 -> ...
     This demonstrates that as new stack frames are added, they use lower addresses.

5. **Your dynamic memory (from malloc()) may not start at the very beginning of the heap. Explain why this is so.**
   
   The first malloc allocation (0x604feafa12b0) doesn't start at the beginning of the heap segment (0x604feafa0000). This gap is due to several factors:
   
   a) Heap management overhead: The memory allocator (e.g., ptmalloc in glibc) needs space for its own data structures to manage allocated and free blocks.
   
   b) Alignment requirements: Memory allocations are often aligned to certain boundaries for performance reasons.
   
   c) Small allocation optimization: Many allocators have optimizations for small allocations, which might be handled differently than larger ones.
   
   d) Security features: Some systems implement security measures like heap canaries or guard pages, which require additional space.
